        <p>I recently rediscovered this dish on a trip to Fresco, Texas.I remember it being one of the only dishes my mother ever prepared the right way.</p>
        <p>These chickpea balls can come out a <em>little</em> grainy, but they are filling and delicious, especially with some green goddess sauce!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dried chickpeas not from a can</li>
            <li>Parsley, cilantro, dill</li>
            <li>Onions, yellow or white</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves, the fresher the better!</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>        
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak dried chickpeas for 24 hours, baking soda helps to soften them. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a food processor. Pulse a little at a time until the texture is like a coarse meal.</li>
            <li>Refridgerate for one hour or overnight. This will help form the balls better.</li>
            <li>Roll into balls like cookie dough.</li>
            <li>Fry slowly in medium-high heat until brown.</li>
            <li>Enjoy in a warm pita with your choice of toppings!</li>
        </ol>
