        <h1>Spaghetti with Cream Sauce</h1>

    <img src="finishedspaghetti.jpeg" alt="a pan filled with tomato cream sauce with two servings of the dish on white plates">
    <p>Here's a creamy tomato sauce recipe given to me by my dear friend Darrell.</p>
    <p>I remember making this dish numerous times after he gave it to me with my friend Wren. We would add different types of hot peppers to add spice but I have included the base recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Jar Prego or other pre-made spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>Minced garlic</li>
        <li>Kosher salt & black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>Italian Herb blend</li>
        <li>Butter optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan combine heavy whipping cream with pre-made sauce. It should come out a bright orange color.</li>
            <li>Turn stovetop to medium heat, stirring regularly.</li>
            <li>Add garlic, herbs, red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper. Taste as you go and add more of each ingredient as you wish.</li>
            <li>Serve over spaghetti with fresh parmesan cheese sprinkled over it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
